# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: the ZeroDivisionError. This occurs when a program attempts to divide a number by zero, resulting in a runtime exception.

The `bug.py` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates how to handle this error using exception handling to gracefully manage this potential issue.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Python for preventing program crashes and improving reliability.
